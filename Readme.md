This is my master thesis. 

The thesis was developed focusing on the product architect’s perspective in the tele-communication industry, who generally wish to choose the best product which support the user. 
It will analyze how close the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementations in the Linux and FreeBSD Operating systems follow the standards. 

Since SCTP was described in RFC 4960, standardized by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 2007. RFC 4960 obsoletes the previous RFC 2960 and RFC 3309. 
RFC 9260 standardized in June 2022, obsoletes RFC 4960.  

To understand the operating system’s compliance to the standard as per the RFC, this thesis mainly focus on the comparison of the RFC 4960 & RFC 9260. 
The results obtained from the comparative analysis between the RFCs resulted in getting the precise test cases. 
Priority of the study has been given to the test cases focusing security related changes and the functionality changes.  
The test cases are scripted in packet drill and have been executed in both the operating systems and the results will compare and test the completeness and effectiveness of the SCTP protocol’s implementation.

Test Cases were written based on the changes effective in RFC 9260.

Three group of test cases were executed.
Group 1: Security Related Test Cases
Group 2: Functionality Changes
Group 3: Other Parameters
